Spent Time Figuring out Custom Events (May Not use what I got)
Lead into Mixins
Spent times figuring how to use Mixins
Got FireBlock Mixin to work
- Still kinda pissed that there is no block on fire event in fabric.
Can Extend Items & use the base method for registering Items
-Must call method in the class where the items are being registered
Spent time working out the rough basics of the KeyBinds, Not properly registered yet


Regret taking on Conversion of base mod from Forge to Fabric
