- Added woodFence & woodFenceGate

Removed
- Custom Logger
== was not functioning properly

Fixed
- Config file

Removed
- org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.32
- ch.qos.logback:logback-classic:1.2.9
== No longer going to be used
== could have gotten the Logger to work, but was ended up being redundant work for no extra benefit over using the included logger.
==== Got lost in the weeds real deep.

Config File adjustments
- set a cool-down on writing the config file.
-- Now will only read the file in on Server Started event
- Modified saving file
-- Will now verify all the values have a value
-- will only do it if the current values are not the same as the ones in the file
-- will only do it on a cool-down
-- can be triggered by loading or unloading a dimension/aka server level.

Added
- Cut sand Stones (PillarBlock) versions.

Time Spent
- Alot of time was spent ironing the Config file setup
- Time was spent ironing out the (now removed) alternative Logger
- typing
- going over code stability, functionality, & coding definitions with aid.
