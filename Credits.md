## Description
AtticusJay has redone the textures for Sands and Sandstones, which includes a top, side, and bottom file for use in all versions. Their work has greatly improved the visual quality of the overall look and added more detail to the mod. This helps merge the blocks into the base game in a smoother fashion.
